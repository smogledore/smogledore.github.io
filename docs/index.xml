      <description>Hey, I’m Sébastien! Designer for more than a decade, I bring an engineering perspective and creative problem- solving approach to create products that people can easily use. Download my resume
What my colleagues say &#34;Our collaboration unlocked the storytelling power of UX and helped steer the focus away from patchwork-like short term fixes by putting the user needs in the very center.&#34; — Tibor K, Staff Product Designer
&#34;Working with Sébastien on design driven topics is always a pleasure and shows how valuable it is to work in a collaborative way on an application – being able to adjust, fix &amp; deliver components of high quality.</description>
