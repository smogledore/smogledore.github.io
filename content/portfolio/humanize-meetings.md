## Problem statement

With the COVID-19 health pandemic spreading around the world, many employees transitioned to remote work, using video conferencing applications extensively.

While there is no doubt that technology has greatly supported remote collaboration during these moments of isolation, the sudden shift led workers to start reporting meeting fatigue, a new phenomenon of feeling tired and exhausted attributed to an excessive usage of online meetings.
Since then, the topic has been widely covered in the media, with the term counting over 700,000 hits on Google by the end of 2020.

Additionally, maintaining human contact between colleagues is even more challenging in this new environment where work has radically changed and anxiety about social interactions is amplified. To preserve the well-being of its users, and also stay competitive as the adoption of video conferencing apps increases, GoTo Meeting must offer a solution that will reduce meeting fatigue.

## Discovery

Before starting to shape a solution, the team wanted to learn more about meeting fatigue, its causes and how to avoid it. We searched online for documentation and studies on this phenomenon from a psychological perspective, to help us define what it means to humanize a digital experience.

We collected insights and found several possible reasons to explain meeting fatigue, such as a significant effort required to interact with others and demonstrate engagement despite a lack of non-verbal cues, a strive to look good on camera, a higher cognitive load due to a lot of faces to process on the screen…
Another important learning was that meeting fatigue can also have serious consequences on health and can potentially lead to burnout.

## Ideation

Based on the learnings from the discovery phase, we brainstormed and generated as many ideas as possible to answer the question “How might we reduce meeting fatigue?”. All items were sorted around different clusters for better visibility and decisions making, with "Group belongingness" being the most interesting to the group.

## The solution

<div class="row mb-4">

<div class="col-7">

### 1. Hide self-view

Many people find it distracting to see themselves on screen for hours. Some will pay particular attention to ensuring that the lighting is correct, the tilt of the screen just perfect, and that they are wearing their best clothes. They might appreciate to see their image on the screen, but others, however, can have a hard time being comfortable on camera and may feel exposed in ways they don’t normally feel in group situations.

Unfortunately, turning on their webcam is sometimes the most effective way for participants to be considered active in a meeting, unlike those who are represented by a profile picture or avatar and can be considered away from the group, even if actively contributing to the conversation.

Therefore, to reduce the amount of stimuli on screen, users would need to have their camera visible to other participants without displaying it on their own screen. Due the value it provides and its ease of implementation, the solution to hide self-view has been clearly identified as an easy win. In addition, it will increase accessibility for people with cognitive impairments.
