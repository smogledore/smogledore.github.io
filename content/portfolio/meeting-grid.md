## Problem statement

A key point in GoTo's recent business strategy was to unify its complex portfolio of multiple native applications into a single product and, like many other tech companies, transition to a framework based on web technologies called Electron. Thus, the entire codebase had to be reworked, including the interface implementation of GoTo Meeting, an online videoconferencing application that hosts 80+ million annual online meetings.  

The core of the meeting experience is the camera layout, also called “Meeting Grid”. With a global shift to remote work since the beginning of the pandemic, online meetings are no longer limited to collaborative sessions between a few people but can also extend to several use cases and now accommodate more participants, as during company-wide gatherings for example.  
 
Rebuilding the Meeting Grid was an opportunity to fix known issues and create a solid foundation that could scale for large meetings on the web and desktop versions of GoTo Meeting.

I was in charge of the entire design process for this initiative, including user testing in collaboration with a UX researcher and close teamwork with the engineering team.    

<p class="m-0">I was also in contact with UX designers from the Events team, as the Meeting Grid was also intended to be used for webinars and training as part of the unification effort.</p>
